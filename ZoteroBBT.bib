  abstract = {The properties of pseudo-ternary systems involving brine, sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), pentanol and dodecane or hexane have been investigated. When the hydrocarbon is dodecane, the microemulsion system includes in addition to the main monophasic area a small lens inserted in an oil-rich zone. With hexane, the microemulsion domain splits into two parts, one of which consists of a narrow scythe-blade shaped area which spreads from the water top up to compositions very rich in hydrocarbon. The properties of these uncommon microemulsions were compared with those of microemulsions belonging to the main monophasic area in order to gain additional understanding of their structure. Results of experiments including electrical conductivity and viscosity measurements, electrochemical and fluorescent probe studies lead to the following conclusions: Microemulsions of the small lens of the brine/SDS/pentanol/dodecane system exhibit properties which are reminiscent of structures with at once water and oil countinuous phases. Microemulsions of the lenticular area of the brine/SDS/pentanol/ hexane system seem to undergo the same structural transitions as microemulsions of systems which present a single monophasic area: water-continuous, bicontinuous and oilcontinuous structures.},

  abstract = {Microemulsion systems involving brine and dodecane, and stabilized by sodium dodecylsulfate and both pentanol and heptanol have been investigated. Results of various experiments including conductivity and viscosity measurements, electrochemical diffusion coefficients and fluorescent probe studies have been gathered and compared in order to gain additional understanding of the microemulsion structure. The diffusion coefficients of hydrophilic hydroquinone and hydrophobic ferrocene obtained from the Levich equation at the rotating disc electrode, vary as the self-diffusion coefficients of water and dodecane, respectively; the results are consistent with those obtained by other workers from tracer or NMR self-diffusion studies. The fluorescence analysis of the polarity sensed by pyrene and the microviscosity felt by dipyrenylpropane suggests that the progressive addition of pentanol and dodecane to SDS micelles leads to solubilizate the probes more in the droplet interior where they experience a more hydrophobic environment. The systematic study of the two microemulsion systems provides insight into the microscopic properties of the oil domains in which the fluorescent probes are assumed to be located. In the system stabilized by n-heptanol as cosurfactant, the microviscosity sensed by P(CH2)3P is shown to be much lower than the bulk viscosity of the microemulsion. All the results evidence the well-known structural transitions: water continuous, bicontinuous and oil continuous in the single monophasic area of the brine/ SDS/n-pentanol/dodecane system; premicellar aggregates and water swollen micelles in the W/O area of the brine/SDS/n-heptanol/dodecane system.},

  abstract = {In the context of chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR), there is no well-established way to characterize and understand the physical properties and structures of microemulsions composed of crude oil and industrial surfactants due to their complexity. Making a comparison to a well-studied model system is a simple and effective way to investigate the complex microemulsions. The purpose of this study is to provide and complete experimental characteristic data of model-microemulsions as a basis of analysis of the complex system. Types of microemulsions studied in the present work were oil in water (O/W), bicontinuous, and water in oil (W/O). The system was composed of water, sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS), isobutanol, sodium chloride (NaCl), and decane. We performed several experiments at room temperature such as spinning drop method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Karl Fischer titration, Hyamine titration, dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-SEM). The measurements provided a deeper insight into a correlation between physical properties and morphologies of water/oil in the microemulsions.},

Furthermore, the antioxidant activities of functional liquid foods, such as coffee and olive oil, were also evaluated by means of electrochemical measurements in BME solutions containing analytes in concentrations of several percent.

  abstract = {Efforts were made to prepare bicontinuous microemulsions with ten different oil phases involving aliphatic, linear, and aromatic hydrocarbons as oil phases, two co-surfactants (n-butanol and n-pentanol) and two surfactants: cationic (CTAB) and anionic (SDS). Different weight percentages were employed for the preparation of cationic and anionic surfactant based microemulsions as reported in the literature. Out of the 40 compositions (10 oil phases\texttimes{}2 co-surfactants\texttimes{}2 surfactants) thus selected only 28 systems showed stable bicontinuous microemulsion phase. This behavior is explained on the basis of the structures of various constituents present in the microemulsions. Viscosity variations of stable bicontinuous microemulsions are found to depend mainly on the nature of co-surfactant. Conductivity behavior on the other hand depends mainly on the weight percentage and composition of aqueous phase. The solubility of pyrene in the oil phase determines the excimer formation and fluorescence behavior in microemulsions. The electron transfer property of both the water-soluble and the oil-soluble redox systems does not depend on the oil phase and the co-surfactant. The significance and importance of characterizing well defined bicontinuous microemulsions is thus highlighted.},

Electrochemical contact with the micro-saline and oil phases in a BME is alternately or simultaneously achieved by controlling the hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of the electrode surfaces.

In recent years, the performance of aluminium-ion batteries has improved remarkably in all battery-relevant metrics, which renders them a promising alternative. Compared with monovalent Li-ion batteries, aluminium (Al) cations can carry three positive charges, which could result in higher energy densities.

  abstract = {Developing cheap and durable proton exchange membrane is crucial to promote the practical application of vanadium flow batteries (VFB). Here we report a simple and scalable method to fabricate a reinforced sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) membrane using a lithium-ion battery separator, ceramic-coated porous polyethylene (CCP), as a robust scaffold. With the confinement effect of the extremely stable CCP substrate, the reinforced SPEEK membrane (S@CCP) shows significantly improved chemical/mechanical stability and reduced vanadium ion permeability compared to the control SPEEK membrane. Accordingly, the S@CCP membrane demonstrates excellent rate performance and cycling stability than those of the benchmark Nafion 212 membrane. It exhibits stable performance over 1500 cycles at 160 mA cm\textendash{}2 with 99\% of CE, 76\% of EE and 0.126\% of capacity decay per cycle. Meanwhile, the S@CCP membrane is highly resistant to temperature fluctuations over a wide range of -20\textendash{}60 \textdegree{}C. The superior durability, wide temperature adaptability, and low cost suggest that the S@CCP membrane offers great promise as an ideal membrane for VFB application.},

  volume = {314},
  issn = {0021-9797},
  abstract = {Efforts were made to prepare bicontinuous microemulsions with ten different oil phases involving aliphatic, linear, and aromatic hydrocarbons as oil phases, two co-surfactants (n-butanol and n-pentanol) and two surfactants: cationic (CTAB) and anionic (SDS). Different weight percentages were employed for the preparation of cationic and anionic surfactant based microemulsions as reported in the literature. Out of the 40 compositions (10 oil phases\texttimes{}2 co-surfactants\texttimes{}2 surfactants) thus selected only 28 systems showed stable bicontinuous microemulsion phase. This behavior is explained on the basis of the structures of various constituents present in the microemulsions. Viscosity variations of stable bicontinuous microemulsions are found to depend mainly on the nature of co-surfactant. Conductivity behavior on the other hand depends mainly on the weight percentage and composition of aqueous phase. The solubility of pyrene in the oil phase determines the excimer formation and fluorescence behavior in microemulsions. The electron transfer property of both the water-soluble and the oil-soluble redox systems does not depend on the oil phase and the co-surfactant. The significance and importance of characterizing well defined bicontinuous microemulsions is thus highlighted.},

At lower sweep-rates, irreversible chemical reactions intervene leading to further oxidation, the standard potentials of subsequent steps being close to that for the first charge-transfer. Anthracene, pyrene, phenanthrene and triphenylene exhibit similar limiting behaviour of anodic currents and peak potentials at high scan-rates, which is identified with the formation of radical cations: the cations of these hydrocarbons have a life-time of a few milliseconds. The common supposition that the primary electrode process involves the formation of the dipositive ion is thus incorrect. Moreover, conventional polarographic oxidation potentials of the unsubstituted compounds are controlled by chemical reaction. The reversible oxidation potentials for the charge-transfer step have been evaluated from the data at high rates of voltage sweep.},

The results indicated that the polypyrene was formed mainly through dehydro coupling between 2- or 1- and 2{${'}$}- or 1{${'}$}-positions on pyrene rings having a degree of polymerization of around 24. The polypyrene was purified and then separated into THF-soluble (ca. 10 \%) and THF-insoluble (ca. 90 \%) fractions. Compared with insulating pyrene monomer, the polypyrene is a controllably conducting polymer that has low conductivity of 3.4\texttimes{}10-8 S cm-1 in its virgin state, moderate conductivity of 2.28\texttimes{}10-4 S cm-1 upon iodine doping, but much higher conductivity of up to 81.2 S cm-1 after the insoluble polypyrene was heated up to 1300 \textdegree{}C in nitrogen with a high char yield of 70.6 \%. In particular, the soluble polypyrene demonstrates much stronger visible color fluorescence and much lower toxicity than pyrene. The soluble polypyrene would be advantageous for detecting Fe3+ with almost no interference of other metal ions. The soluble and insoluble polypyrene fractions have potential applications as intrinsically luminescent and highly conducting carbon materials, respectively.},

DFT calculations and electrochemistry revealed that this category of compound possesses hole-transporting characteristics.

In this study, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are introduced within a functionalized few-walled carbon nanotube matrix to develop high-energy, high-power positive electrodes for pseudocapacitor applications. The reduction potential and capacity of various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are correlated with their interaction with the functionalized few-walled carbon nanotube matrix, chemical configuration and electronic structure. These findings provide rational design criteria for nanostructured organic electrodes. When combined with lithium negative electrodes, these nanostructured organic electrodes exhibit energy densities of {$\sim$}350 Wh kg-1electrode at power densities of {$\sim$}10 kW kg-1electrode for over 10,000 cycles.},

The C60 polymer (C60-O) film was also investigated by Raman spectroscopy and imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) both at the early and advanced polymerization stage. While the spectroelectrochemical behavior of the C60/C60\textbullet{}- couple in the presence of O2 was similar to that in its absence, at more negative potentials corresponding to C602- and O2\textbullet{}- formation C602- participated in a chemical follow-up reaction resulting in a product lacking any diagnostic absorption band in the vis-NIR range. Although the main peak in the MS spectrum of the one-electron reduction product was that of C60 at m/z of 720, several additional peaks in the m/z range of 739-760 appeared, indicating generation of C60O\textbullet{}- and C60O2\textbullet{}- followed by their protonation. Interestingly, the MS spectrum of the product of two-electron reduction of C60 revealed several peaks in the m/z range of 1297-1465. These peaks correspond to the oxygen-containing fullerene protonated dimers, which lose the Cn (n = 1, 2) or C2n (n = 2-5) fragments upon ionization. Apparently, products of the C602- and O2\textbullet{}- interaction spontaneously dimerize in the electrode vicinity. Importantly, oxygen is built into the dimeric molecule in the initial stage of electropolymerization. The Raman spectroscopy measurements and AFM surface imaging of the C60-O film revealed that the first CV cycle resulted in an electrodeposition of dimers. With the increase of the number of CV cycles, the extent of polymerization increased and the polymer structure became highly heterogeneous. Finally, an electrophoretically deposited film of the HiPCO single-wall carbon nanotubes (pyr-SWCNTs) noncovalently surface modified with 1-pyrenebutyric acid was coated by electropolymerization with the C60-O film under CV conditions to result in a polymer-CNT composite material. AFM imaging of this film showed that tangles of the pyr-SWCNTs bundles, coated with the C60-O globules, were formed. The electrochemical and viscoelastic properties of the pyr-SWCNTs|C60-O film were unraveled by simultaneously performed CV and piezoelectric microgravimetry (PM) measurements in a blank (TBA)ClO4 acetonitrile solution. Specific capacitance of the electrode coated with this composite film was 184 F g-1, a value comparable to those for other SWNT composite film coated electrodes, suggesting a plausible application of this material in developing supercapacitors.},
