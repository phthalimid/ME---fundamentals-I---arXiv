  abstract = {Over the last decade, optimizing energy storage has become significantly important in the field of energy conversion and sustainability. As a result of immense progress in the field, cost-effective and high performance batteries are imperative to meeting the future demand of sustainability. Currently, the best performing batteries are lithium-ion based, but limited lithium (Li) resources make research into alternatives essential. In recent years, the performance of aluminium-ion batteries has improved remarkably in all battery-relevant metrics, which renders them a promising alternative. Compared with monovalent Li-ion batteries, aluminium (Al) cations can carry three positive charges, which could result in higher energy densities. This review describes recent developments in Al-based cathode materials. The major goal of this review is to highlight strengths and weaknesses of various different approaches and provide guidelines for future research.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical energy-storage devices have the potential to be clean and efficient, but their current cost and performance limit their use in numerous transportation and stationary applications. Many organic molecules are abundant, economical and electrochemically active; if selected correctly and rationally designed, these organic molecules offer a promising route to expand the applications of these energy-storage devices. In this study, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are introduced within a functionalized few-walled carbon nanotube matrix to develop high-energy, high-power positive electrodes for pseudocapacitor applications. The reduction potential and capacity of various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are correlated with their interaction with the functionalized few-walled carbon nanotube matrix, chemical configuration and electronic structure. These findings provide rational design criteria for nanostructured organic electrodes. When combined with lithium negative electrodes, these nanostructured organic electrodes exhibit energy densities of {$\sim$}350 Wh kg-1electrode at power densities of {$\sim$}10 kW kg-1electrode for over 10,000 cycles.},

Despite the presence of the tert-butyl group located at the 7-position of pyrene, X-ray crystallographic analyses show that the planarity of the Y-shaped molecules still exhibits strong face-to-face {$\pi$}-{$\pi$} stacking in the solid state; all of the compounds exhibit blue or green emission with high quantum yields (QYs) in dichloromethane. DFT calculations and electrochemistry revealed that this category of compound possesses hole-transporting characteristics. In addition, with strong electron-donating (-N(CH3)2) or electron-withdrawing (-CHO) groups in 2 d or 2 f, these molecules displayed efficient intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) emissions with solvatochromic shifts from blue to yellow (green) on increasing the solvent polarity. Furthermore, the compounds 2 d and 2 f possess strong CT characteristics.},

Making a comparison to a well-studied model system is a simple and effective way to investigate the complex microemulsions. The purpose of this study is to provide and complete experimental characteristic data of model-microemulsions as a basis of analysis of the complex system. Types of microemulsions studied in the present work were oil in water (O/W), bicontinuous, and water in oil (W/O). The system was composed of water, sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS), isobutanol, sodium chloride (NaCl), and decane. We performed several experiments at room temperature such as spinning drop method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Karl Fischer titration, Hyamine titration, dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-SEM). The measurements provided a deeper insight into a correlation between physical properties and morphologies of water/oil in the microemulsions.},

When the hydrocarbon is dodecane, the microemulsion system includes in addition to the main monophasic area a small lens inserted in an oil-rich zone. With hexane, the microemulsion domain splits into two parts, one of which consists of a narrow scythe-blade shaped area which spreads from the water top up to compositions very rich in hydrocarbon. The properties of these uncommon microemulsions were compared with those of microemulsions belonging to the main monophasic area in order to gain additional understanding of their structure. Results of experiments including electrical conductivity and viscosity measurements, electrochemical and fluorescent probe studies lead to the following conclusions: Microemulsions of the small lens of the brine/SDS/pentanol/dodecane system exhibit properties which are reminiscent of structures with at once water and oil countinuous phases. Microemulsions of the lenticular area of the brine/SDS/pentanol/ hexane system seem to undergo the same structural transitions as microemulsions of systems which present a single monophasic area: water-continuous, bicontinuous and oilcontinuous structures.},

Results of various experiments including conductivity and viscosity measurements, electrochemical diffusion coefficients and fluorescent probe studies have been gathered and compared in order to gain additional understanding of the microemulsion structure. The diffusion coefficients of hydrophilic hydroquinone and hydrophobic ferrocene obtained from the Levich equation at the rotating disc electrode, vary as the self-diffusion coefficients of water and dodecane, respectively; the results are consistent with those obtained by other workers from tracer or NMR self-diffusion studies. The fluorescence analysis of the polarity sensed by pyrene and the microviscosity felt by dipyrenylpropane suggests that the progressive addition of pentanol and dodecane to SDS micelles leads to solubilizate the probes more in the droplet interior where they experience a more hydrophobic environment. The systematic study of the two microemulsion systems provides insight into the microscopic properties of the oil domains in which the fluorescent probes are assumed to be located. In the system stabilized by n-heptanol as cosurfactant, the microviscosity sensed by P(CH2)3P is shown to be much lower than the bulk viscosity of the microemulsion. All the results evidence the well-known structural transitions: water continuous, bicontinuous and oil continuous in the single monophasic area of the brine/ SDS/n-pentanol/dodecane system; premicellar aggregates and water swollen micelles in the W/O area of the brine/SDS/n-heptanol/dodecane system.},

The conductivity data were explained by the modified Bruggeman equation in the entire experimental range of {$\varphi$}0 in the case of octane and nitrobenzene and in a limited range of {$\varphi$}0 in the case of other oils. The value of the slope of this equation, f, is found to depend on (i) the concentration of surfactant or the R value, (ii) the nature of the oil, and (iii) the nature and number of substituents, if the oil is a substituted benzene. The specific conductivity data of o/w MEs of R = 120 and 100 were also analyzed in the light of the mixed electrolyte model, and the values of aggregation number, counterion binding constant, and radius of droplet were computed.},

However, the narrow electrochemical stability window (about 1.23 V) of the aqueous electrolyte sets a limit on their energy output. Herein, we have developed an aqueous rechargeable hybrid battery using Na2MnFe(CN)6 nanocubes as the cathode and a zinc metal sheet as the anode, which delivered a high energy density of 170 W h kg-1 and a capacity retention of 75\% over 2000 cycles with an operating voltage of up to 2.0 V. By adding sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to the aqueous electrolyte, the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte was expanded to about 2.5 V. The results of the experiments and calculations based on the density functional theory indicate that SDS can not only inhibit the decomposition of water, suppress the dissolution of Mn and the corrosion of zinc but also increase the cycle life and rate capability. The low-cost, high energy density, and long cycle life of the battery suggest that it is a promising candidate for energy storage applications.},

  abstract = {Bicontinuous microemulsions (BMEs, Winsor III), also called middle-phase microemulsions, are low-viscosity, isotropic, thermodynamically stable, and spontaneously formed mixtures of water, oil, and surfactants. They are unique solution media for electrochemistry. Here, we introduce the recent progress in the electrochemistry of BMEs from their fundamental aspects to their practical applications. Electrochemistry using BMEs has two irreplaceable properties: the coexistence of hydrophilic and lipophilic species with high self-diffusion coefficients; and the dynamic deformation of structures at an oil/water/electrode ternary interface, which is easily changed according to the property of the electrode surface. Electrochemical contact with the micro-saline and oil phases in a BME is alternately or simultaneously achieved by controlling the hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of the electrode surfaces. The selective electrochemical analysis of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants in liquid foods without extraction demonstrated as the use of the unique ternary solution structures of BME on solid surfaces.},

  abstract = {Qualitative and quantitative analyses of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants, such as polyphenols, by simple electrochemical measurements were conducted in a bicontinuous microemulsion (BME), in which water and oil phases coexisted bicontinuously on a microscopic scale. Hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants were individually monitored in the same BME solution using a hydrophilic indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and a lipophilic fluorinated nanocarbon film electrode (F-ECR), respectively. The combination of well-balanced BME and extremely biased electrodes, such as ITO and F-ECR, in terms of hydrophilic\textendash{}lipophilic balance allowed us to achieve individual monitoring of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants in the same BME solution without extraction. Furthermore, the antioxidant activities of functional liquid foods, such as coffee and olive oil, were also evaluated by means of electrochemical measurements in BME solutions containing analytes in concentrations of several percent. The technique we propose provides a very simple, rapid, easily serviceable, and highly reproducible analysis and can be extended to a wide range of analytes and media.},

  abstract = {A wholly aromatic polypyrene was synthesized by direct chemical oxidative polymerization of pyrene with ferric chloride as oxidant in hexane/nitromethane. Successful synthesis of polypyrene was thoroughly confirmed by IR, UV/Vis, 1D 1H NMR, 2D 1H\textendash{}1H COSY, 2D 1H\textendash{}13C HSQC, MALDI-TOF MS, elemental analysis, and X-ray diffraction methods. The results indicated that the polypyrene was formed mainly through dehydro coupling between 2- or 1- and 2{${'}$}- or 1{${'}$}-positions on pyrene rings having a degree of polymerization of around 24. The polypyrene was purified and then separated into THF-soluble (ca. 10 \%) and THF-insoluble (ca. 90 \%) fractions. Compared with insulating pyrene monomer, the polypyrene is a controllably conducting polymer that has low conductivity of 3.4\texttimes{}10-8 S cm-1 in its virgin state, moderate conductivity of 2.28\texttimes{}10-4 S cm-1 upon iodine doping, but much higher conductivity of up to 81.2 S cm-1 after the insoluble polypyrene was heated up to 1300 \textdegree{}C in nitrogen with a high char yield of 70.6 \%. In particular, the soluble polypyrene demonstrates much stronger visible color fluorescence and much lower toxicity than pyrene. The soluble polypyrene would be advantageous for detecting Fe3+ with almost no interference of other metal ions. The soluble and insoluble polypyrene fractions have potential applications as intrinsically luminescent and highly conducting carbon materials, respectively.},

Here we report a simple and scalable method to fabricate a reinforced sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) membrane using a lithium-ion battery separator, ceramic-coated porous polyethylene (CCP), as a robust scaffold. With the confinement effect of the extremely stable CCP substrate, the reinforced SPEEK membrane (S@CCP) shows significantly improved chemical/mechanical stability and reduced vanadium ion permeability compared to the control SPEEK membrane. Accordingly, the S@CCP membrane demonstrates excellent rate performance and cycling stability than those of the benchmark Nafion 212 membrane. It exhibits stable performance over 1500 cycles at 160 mA cm\textendash{}2 with 99\% of CE, 76\% of EE and 0.126\% of capacity decay per cycle. Meanwhile, the S@CCP membrane is highly resistant to temperature fluctuations over a wide range of -20\textendash{}60 \textdegree{}C. The superior durability, wide temperature adaptability, and low cost suggest that the S@CCP membrane offers great promise as an ideal membrane for VFB application.},

  abstract = {Microemulsions are exciting systems that are promising as tuneable self-assembling templating reaction vessels at the nanoscale. Determination of the nano-structure of microemulsions is, however, not trivial, and there are fundamental questions regarding their design. We were able to reproduce experimental data for an important microemulsion system, sodium-AOT\textendash{}n-heptane\textendash{}water, using coarse-grained simulations involving relatively limited computational costs. The simulation allows visualization and deeper investigation of controversial phenomena such as bicontinuity and ion mobility. Simulations were performed using the Martini coarse-grained force field. AOT bonded parameters were fine-tuned by matching the geometry obtained from atomistic simulations. We investigated several compositions with a constant ratio of surfactant to oil while the water content was varied from 10 to 60\% in weight. From mean square displacement calculation of all species, it was possible to quantify caging effects and ion mobility. Average diffusion coefficients were calculated for all charged species and trends in the diffusion coefficients were used to rationalize experimental conductivity data. Especially, the diffusion coefficient of charged species qualitatively matched the variation in conductivity as a function of water content. The scattering function was calculated for the hydrophilic species and up to 40\% water content quantitatively matched the experimental data obtained from small angle X-ray scattering measurements. For higher water contents, discrepancies were observed and attributed to a nearby phase separation. In particular, bicontinuity of water and oil was computationally visualized by plotting the coordinates of hydrophilic beads. Equilibrated coarse-grained simulations were reversed to atomistic models in order both to compare ion mobility and to catch finer simulation details. Especially, it was possible to capture the intimate ion pair interaction between the sodium ion and the surfactant head group.},

At lower sweep-rates, irreversible chemical reactions intervene leading to further oxidation, the standard potentials of subsequent steps being close to that for the first charge-transfer. Anthracene, pyrene, phenanthrene and triphenylene exhibit similar limiting behaviour of anodic currents and peak potentials at high scan-rates, which is identified with the formation of radical cations: the cations of these hydrocarbons have a life-time of a few milliseconds. The common supposition that the primary electrode process involves the formation of the dipositive ion is thus incorrect. Moreover, conventional polarographic oxidation potentials of the unsubstituted compounds are controlled by chemical reaction. The reversible oxidation potentials for the charge-transfer step have been evaluated from the data at high rates of voltage sweep.},

  abstract = {The superoxide anion radical, O2\textbullet{}-, induced C60 electropolymerization mechanism was refined by simultaneous cyclic voltammetric (CV) and vis-NIR spectroelectrochemical as well as mass spectrometric (MALDI-TOF) characterization of the one- and two-electron reduction products of C60 in the presence of O2 in a mixed organic solvent solution. The C60 polymer (C60-O) film was also investigated by Raman spectroscopy and imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) both at the early and advanced polymerization stage. While the spectroelectrochemical behavior of the C60/C60\textbullet{}- couple in the presence of O2 was similar to that in its absence, at more negative potentials corresponding to C602- and O2\textbullet{}- formation C602- participated in a chemical follow-up reaction resulting in a product lacking any diagnostic absorption band in the vis-NIR range. Although the main peak in the MS spectrum of the one-electron reduction product was that of C60 at m/z of 720, several additional peaks in the m/z range of 739-760 appeared, indicating generation of C60O\textbullet{}- and C60O2\textbullet{}- followed by their protonation. Interestingly, the MS spectrum of the product of two-electron reduction of C60 revealed several peaks in the m/z range of 1297-1465. These peaks correspond to the oxygen-containing fullerene protonated dimers, which lose the Cn (n = 1, 2) or C2n (n = 2-5) fragments upon ionization. Apparently, products of the C602- and O2\textbullet{}- interaction spontaneously dimerize in the electrode vicinity. Importantly, oxygen is built into the dimeric molecule in the initial stage of electropolymerization. The Raman spectroscopy measurements and AFM surface imaging of the C60-O film revealed that the first CV cycle resulted in an electrodeposition of dimers. With the increase of the number of CV cycles, the extent of polymerization increased and the polymer structure became highly heterogeneous. Finally, an electrophoretically deposited film of the HiPCO single-wall carbon nanotubes (pyr-SWCNTs) noncovalently surface modified with 1-pyrenebutyric acid was coated by electropolymerization with the C60-O film under CV conditions to result in a polymer-CNT composite material. AFM imaging of this film showed that tangles of the pyr-SWCNTs bundles, coated with the C60-O globules, were formed. The electrochemical and viscoelastic properties of the pyr-SWCNTs|C60-O film were unraveled by simultaneously performed CV and piezoelectric microgravimetry (PM) measurements in a blank (TBA)ClO4 acetonitrile solution. Specific capacitance of the electrode coated with this composite film was 184 F g-1, a value comparable to those for other SWNT composite film coated electrodes, suggesting a plausible application of this material in developing supercapacitors.},

Different weight percentages were employed for the preparation of cationic and anionic surfactant based microemulsions as reported in the literature. Out of the 40 compositions (10 oil phases\texttimes{}2 co-surfactants\texttimes{}2 surfactants) thus selected only 28 systems showed stable bicontinuous microemulsion phase. This behavior is explained on the basis of the structures of various constituents present in the microemulsions. Viscosity variations of stable bicontinuous microemulsions are found to depend mainly on the nature of co-surfactant. Conductivity behavior on the other hand depends mainly on the weight percentage and composition of aqueous phase. The solubility of pyrene in the oil phase determines the excimer formation and fluorescence behavior in microemulsions. The electron transfer property of both the water-soluble and the oil-soluble redox systems does not depend on the oil phase and the co-surfactant. The significance and importance of characterizing well defined bicontinuous microemulsions is thus highlighted.},

The polarity environment of the SFME was investigated. Solid silica nanoparticle (SSN) was selected as a model nanomaterial to investigate the feasibility of the water/ethanol/dichloromethane SFME for the preparation of nanomaterials. In the O/W SFME region of the microemulsions, uniform spherical solid silica nanoparticles (SSNs) were synthesized.

The effects of tetraethylorthosilicate concentration (CTEOS), ammonia hydroxide concentration (CNH3{$\bullet$}H2O) and dichloromethane content on the size and morphology of the SSNs were investigated. The average diameters of the SSNs increased with increasing CTEOS andCNH3{$\bullet$}H2O. However, the effect of increasing CNH3{$\bullet$}H2O on the particle size is more significant.
